Here is all my advice about getting a job, particularly if you are coming from academia or switching fields. If you are considering a career change, I like to recommend this little book called [A job to love](https://bookshop.org/p/books/a-job-to-love-a-practical-guide-to-finding-fulfilling-work-by-better-understanding-yourself-the-school-of-life/6566657?ean=9780993538759&next=t).

Finding a great job is a long journey, and interviewing for prolonged periods of time can be demoralizing. Find ways to reset that will keep you sane. When I am going through this process, I find it helpful to re-read a book called [Mindset](https://bookshop.org/p/books/mindset-the-new-psychology-of-success-carol-s-dweck/7841782?ean=9780345472328&next=t), by Carol Dweck. 

Now, let's get into it. 

## Build your network 

Most jobs I have gotten have come from my network. Connect with everyone that you know on LinkedIn, and reach out to any connections you haven't spoken to in a while. Check out my [post on career mentors]({{site.baseurl}}/career/mentors/) and update your lists. 


## Search

Find the jobs or companies you're interested in, then use LinkedIn search to find connections that you have in common with that job keyword at that company. Don't limit yourself only to open roles!

Create a spreadsheet that lists the companies you are interested in, whether you have identified open job recs for roles of interest, and all 1st and 2nd order LinkedIn connections who worked there (or had recently worked there and left amicably).  

Second order LinkedIn connections that go through a close connection of yours (eg. a former colleague who knows you well, or a close friend and collaborator) may be more useful than a first-order connection that you do not know very well. 

For each role or company, choose the most relevant referral that you can. When you reach out to your connections, ask them for a specific action. You can link the JD that you're interested in, and/or ask if they know anyone on that team and whether they'd be comfortable connecting you for an informational interview.  

### Dos and don'ts of referral requests

| Do    | Do Not |
| -------- | ------- |
| Reach out to your best-known connections first, and ask for introductions  | Ask them to "keep you in mind for a job."     |
| Be specific about the actions you want them to take. Eg. "Can you introduce me to someone who works on this team for an informational interview, I would like to learn more" or "Can you refer me for JobID #" | Ask them to tell you what jobs at their company may be a fit for your skills.     |

Outreach takes effort, but it is probably the most impactful thing you can do well. Using the right language will help people help you. It's much easier  for someone to respond 'yes I know that person, let me connect,' than it is for them to search for you. 

## Apply

Create a generic resume and cover letter, with a few sentences that can be tailored for each job. [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/tagged/cv) is great for resume creation.


## Interview

[The Muse](https://www.themuse.com/) is a good resource for job search/changes.  It has great general advice, and also specifics for getting into data science etc.  It also has great negotiation tips for when the time comes. 

Consider using a book like [101 answers to the toughest interview questions](https://bookshop.org/p/books/101-great-answers-to-the-toughest-interview-questions-ron-fry/572517?ean=9781632650344&next=t) to prep for basic interview stuff. The exercises will help you focus your story. 

Prepare specific, short stories from past experiences that would answer common behavioral questions and demonstrate the attributes they're looking for. The stories should follow the STAR format, providing a few sentences to quickly describe the Situation you faced, the Task you needed to accomplish, the Action you took, and the Result or impact you had.  I recommend writing these down and marveling at how brief they can be. Then practice telling them.

It's good to keep your stories in a list, so that you can put a checkmark next to ones that you've already told. You don't want to repeat the same story to multiple people at the same company, since they should compare notes during the debrief. 

Be patient! I interviewed for about 30 roles the last time I was job hunting. In each conversation I learned more about what I was looking for and how to interview well for these roles. I wasn't thinking of it as trying to win the job, but trying to find the job that needs the skills I had at that time.

## Negotiate!

Congratulations on getting to this stage!  Take a breath.  If you are coming from academia, you might be intimidated about negotiation. You might even feel so grateful to have a job offer that you think you should accept right away.  I highly recommend that you first read [this salary negotiation advice for academics](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2012/01/23/salary-negotiation/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=salary-negotiation).
